# Refactoring


## Review algorithm

Me, personnaly divide review to three parts:

1. **Is code working as it is?**
	*In standalone environment. There i need to check all logic inside functions and so on. It's similar to unit-testing, and in test covered production maybe not so nessecary, because we assume, that code tested before pull request*

2. **Will code be working in production environment?**
	*How that code will interact with other things in production?*

	- Is the pipeline idempotent? 
	- Are they incorrectly using "current time" in the pipeline?
	- Are they using date > "start date" without a corresponding date < "end date" 
	- Are they doing JOINs with SCD (slowly changing dimension) tables that don't have the needed timeframe filters

	- Is the data model efficient? 
	- Is there any excessive data duplication?
	- Could they leverage complex data types for a better model?  
	- Are the column names reasonable and understandable? 

	- Do they have data quality checks at all?
	- Are they checking for NULLs, duplicates, and malformed values?
	- Are they doing row count anomaly detection?  
	- Will any of these quality checks be excessively noisy?

	- Can pipeline be less costy (in cloud solutions)?

3. **Refactoring**
	*Can code be cleaner, with the same functionality?*



## Refactoring tips

0. **Use type hints everywhere!**

0. **Split functionality to functions for convinient maintaining and testing**

0. **Add testing wherever you can**

1. Merge nested if-statements:

```python
if a:
    if b:
        pass

# -> refactor
if a and b:
    pass
```

2. Use any/all instead of a loop

```python
numbers = [-1, -2, -4, 0, 3, -7]
has_positives = False
for n in numbers:
    if n > 0:
        has_positives = True
        break

# -> refactor
has_positives = any(n > 0 for n in numbers)
```

3. Pull statements/constants out of loop

```python
for building in buildings:
    city = 'London'
    addresses.append(building.street_address, city)

# -> refactor
city = 'London'
for building in buildings:
    addresses.append(building.street_address, city)
```

4. Try to remove variables, that used only once to be returned after.

```python
def state_attributes(self):
    """Return the state attributes."""
    state_attr = {
        ATTR_CODE_FORMAT: self.code_format,
        ATTR_CHANGED_BY: self.changed_by,
    }
    return state_attr

# -> refactor
def state_attributes(self):
    """Return the state attributes."""
    return {
        ATTR_CODE_FORMAT: self.code_format,
        ATTR_CHANGED_BY: self.changed_by,
    }
```

5. Add a guard clause

```python
def should_i_wear_this_hat(self, hat):
    if isinstance(hat, Hat):
        current_fashion = get_fashion()
        weather_outside = self.look_out_of_window()
        is_stylish = self.evaluate_style(hat, current_fashion)
        if weather_outside.is_raining:
            print("Damn.")
            return True
        else:
            print("Great.")
            return is_stylish
    else:
        return False

# -> refactor
def should_i_wear_this_hat(self, hat):
    if not isinstance(hat, Hat):
        return False

    current_fashion = get_fashion()
    weather_outside = self.look_out_of_window()
    is_stylish = self.evaluate_style(hat, current_fashion)
    if weather_outside.is_raining:
        print("Damn.")
        return True
    else:
        print("Great.")
        return is_stylish
```

6. Movs assignments closer to their usage

```python
def should_i_wear_this_hat(self, hat):
    if not isinstance(hat, Hat):
        return False

    current_fashion = get_fashion()
    weather_outside = self.look_out_of_window()
    is_stylish = self.evaluate_style(hat, current_fashion)
    if weather_outside.is_raining:
        print("Damn.")
        return True
    else:
        print("Great.")
        return is_stylish

# -> refactor
def should_i_wear_this_hat(self, hat):
    if not isinstance(hat, Hat):
        return False

    weather_outside = self.look_out_of_window()
    if weather_outside.is_raining:
        print("Damn.")
        return True
    else:
        print("Great.")
        current_fashion = get_fashion()
        return self.evaluate_style(hat, current_fashion)
        # is_stylish = self.evaluate_style(hat, current_fashion)
        # return is_stylish
```

7. Sumplify check of sequence len. len(of zero len) will return False

```python
if len(list_of_hats) > 0:
    hat_to_wear = choose_hat(list_of_hats)

# -> refactor
if list_of_hats:
    hat_to_wear = choose_hat(list_of_hats)
```

8. Use enumerate, for god sake

```python
for i in range(len(players)):
    print(i, players[i])

# -> refactor
for i, player in enumerate(players, start=1): # also you can use additional start argument
    print(i, player)
```

9. Simplify condition into return statement

```python
def function():
    if isinstance(a, b) or issubclass(b, a):
        return True
    return False

# -> refactor
def function():
    return isinstance(a, b) or issubclass(b, a)
```

10. Merge duplicated blocks into one

```python
def process_payment(payment, currency):
    if currency == "USD":
        process_standard_payment(payment)
    elif currency == "EUR":
        process_standard_payment(payment)
    else:
        process_international_payment(payment)

# -> refactor
def process_payment(payment, currency):
    if currency == "USD" or currency == "EUR":
        process_standard_payment(payment)
    else:
        process_international_payment(payment)
```

or replace it with in, where possible

```python
def process_payment(payment, currency):
    if currency == "USD" or currency == "EUR":
        process_standard_payment(payment)
    else:
        process_international_payment(payment)

# -> refactor
def process_payment(payment, currency):
    if currency in ["USD", "EUR"]:
        process_standard_payment(payment)
    else:
        process_international_payment(payment)
```

11.Replace yield inside for loop with yield from

This is an advanced tip if you are already familiar with generators. 
One little trick that often gets missed is that Pythonâ€™s yield keyword has a corresponding yield from for iterables.

If you have an iterable like a list, instead of saying for item in iterable: yield item, you can simply say yield from iterable. This is shorter and removes the manual looping over the iterable, which can also result in an improved performance.

```python
def get_content(entry):
    for block in entry.get_blocks():
        yield block

# -> refactor
def get_content(entry):
    yield from entry.get_blocks()
```


## System Design

- You drive the interview!
- You should clarify all requirements in the start!

    dev part:
    - How many users/data in the system?
    - is that system for company, or regional, global?
    - is data availiability crucial?
    - what about data latency?
    - OLTP/OLAP share
    - what features should be implemented?
    
    data part:
    - what is source of data?
    - Is it need to be batch or streaming? with which frequency, if batch?
    - size of data?
    - is it migration to cloud, or new system? 
    - who will use that system? BA, DS? 

- You should continiously ask, if interviewer understand your way of thinkning!
