# de-interview-preparation

## Overview
Questions and tasks for Data Engineering interview preparation.<br/>
Made by non-native speaker (and non-native data engineer) for DE tech interview preparation in english.<br/>
This set of tasks and questions doesn't claim to be complete or correct, you have your own head on your shoulders.<br/><br/>

Most python questions based on this repo (in Russian)<br/>
https://github.com/yakimka/python_interview_questions<br/>

## Contribution:
* Feel free to add or correct something
* Please correct language mistakes too
* If somehow this repo will grown into different areas, and not only into DE, it will be quite cool, so feel free add new files with different knowledge. May be in future it will be separated by folders

## Organization of information:
For that time this repo doesn't contains any folders.<br/>
And all questions splitted two different markdown files, united by one particular topic<br/><br/>

If `_tasks` suffix used, that means, that this file contains examples of some coding tasks

de-essentials
├── Python     		(general info about python (de related))
├── Python_tasks	(some coding tasks)
├── Databases		(general info about databases)
├── SQL_tasks		(some sql tasks)
├── ...
└── README<br/>

For sure, it's quite hard sometimes to understand, in which particular category (i mean, when that repo, hopefully will be bigger)<br/><br/>

So in future, when it will be info particularly about PostgreSQL DBMS, for example, it needed to create different md file for that topic only, and not make general 'Databases' topic bigger and bigger
