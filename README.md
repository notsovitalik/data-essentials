# de-essentials

## Overview
Questions and tasks for Data Engineers for interview preparation or something<br/>
Made by non-native speaker (and non-native data engineer)<br/>
This set of tasks and questions doesn't claim to be complete or correct, you have your own head on your shoulders.<br/><br/>

## Contribution
* Feel free to copy, clone and use it on your own, but tbh, it would be better, if you can add youn knowledge inplace, because it will be more convinient to store all in one place
* Feel free to add or correct something
* Please correct language mistakes too

## Organization of information
Mostly this repo is for questions that can be answered in text.
Because it's not about teach you, it's just a short description of concepts etc.

But I want to keep some interesting coding tasks too, and use for that `_tasks` suffix, that means, that this file contains examples of some coding tasks that means

de-essentials<br/>
├── Python     		(general info about python (DE related))<br/>
├── Python_tasks	(some coding tasks)<br/>
├── Databases		(general info about databases)<br/>
├── SQL_tasks		(some sql tasks)<br/>
├── ...<br/>
└── README<br/>

For sure, it's quite hard sometimes to understand, in which particular category (i mean, when that repo, hopefully will be bigger) you should place that topic, but let's just use common sence<br/><br/>

So in future, when it will be info particularly about PostgreSQL DBMS, for example, it needed to create separate file for that topic only, and not make general 'Databases' topic bigger and bigger with PostgreSQL staff.

## In-file markdown rules

For purposes of convenience, uniformity and automatically generated table of contents (in future) let's use this rules:

* Use once and only once H1 heading (\#) at the top of md file, and name it like file itsel
* Use H2 heading (\#\#) for particular topic inside file
* Each heading should starts with Capital letter
* Place Links and Sources for each file in the footer of each file

Table of contents will contains only first (H1) and second headings (H2) level, where first - it's actually file name <br>
And second level - it's links for actual topics in file<br>
Make sure, that there is not too less and not too much second level topics, in order to make table of Contents convinient to use<br>
Someday it may be needed to, when it will be too much info about some topics in files
